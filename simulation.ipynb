    "# Singularity Net Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simulation of the Singularity Net itself.  It's purpose is to compare approaches to problems of the singularity net.  The specific study of this notebook is an initial look at the fundamental problem of how to construct AI software solutions automatically out of AI programs submitted to the Singularity Net.  The simulation tests how different solutions affect Singularity Net values such as delivering maximum utility to people seeking AI software at the lowest cost, giving everyone who makes high quality software a chance to sell, distributing credit where credit is due, and complexification to facilitate a singularity. An important value of the Singularity Net is community participation in its construction, thus we offer the simulation in the competitive arena software of OpenAI to attract the community to playing the \"Singularity\" game, in the spirit of democratic meritocracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simulation is implemented with a combination of Mesa agent based software and OpenAi Gym reinforcement learning competition software. Mesa handles the network of multiple agents, their rules of interaction, and their schedule, and cooperative setups, while OpenAi gym provides reinforcement learning algorithms that agents may use to learn AI combination strategies in a competitive setup.  Mesa simulation agents read and write to a network-mediated blackboard implemented as an openAi environment.  On the blackboard appears human requests for a particular algorithm type that can pass a test (that has a gradient) on a particular dataset for a particular (possibly secret) price range in AGI tokens.  The algorithm type, test, and dataset are from an ontology.   In response, agents can place on the blackboard offers to buy, sell, or construct software from other agents. Construction can include finding appropriate types from the human-designed ontology and parameter settings in combinations that fit particular use cases. However, it can also include inventing new algorithms that trade an input list for an output list (in offer net fashion) that are not listed in the human-designed ontology.   Agents may also display a sign in the form of a vector of floats, and may express their preferences for agents whose sign is closest to an ideal sign.  The sign may be used to rank agents using any agent matching algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation has a general, flexible knowledge representation that is meant to accomodate the needs of different reinforcement learning algorithms.  Different modular reinforcement learning algorithms may compete on the same blackboard in contests to see which algorithms best fill user, developer, and AI growth needs. Alternatively, the simulation could focus on a single algorithm, measuring its effects in isolation, in a more cooperative scenario.  The different algorithms implement agent integration schemes with their own approaches to satisfying the needs of users,devlopers, and growing artificial intelligence. For example, it is up to each reinforcement learning algorithm to assign meanings to the float vector signs that they read and display on the blackboard. Different possible interpretations of the sign's float dimensions include reputation scores, the identity of an agent, the information needed for offernet trades, an emergent agent language or an emergent software ontology that augments the human designed ontology.  Agents may also require that software pass certain tests on data, seen and unseen, before a transaction is accepted.  They have the option to advertise that their software has already passed tests on data.  They have the choice to indicate the type of software they are buying, selling, or constructing with the human ontology, which indicates an input and output list for them.  Alternatively they may offer an input list for an output list and allow the sign field to represent the ontological type.  They have the choice of paying solely through the input and output list without using agi tokens for currency, in order to implement an offer net type of scenario.  During competition, different meanings of signs could either isolate agents into solution groups having the same algorithm, or algorithms groups could learn other group's meanings, creating a competition on the meaning of signs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once all offers are on the blackboard, the openAI environment makes the matches ranked by the cosine distance of the signs that have overlapping prices ranges and exceed agents stated test threshold criteria.  The environment creates the software, and distributes funds.  It funds through the openAi environment reward signal, detailing the particular float vectors that were rewarded through the observation signal.  However it is up to the particular reinforcement learning algorithm to choose what aspects of the environment reward, observation,  and of itself to include in its personal reward.     Mesa keeps track of agent and human utility satisfaction and prices, and measures singularity net values such as adequate exploration of unknown agent capabilities.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This general design promotes Singularity Net values in several ways.  This simulation allows credit to be assigned through the market price signal. However, agents can also gain through more offer-net type utility based trades, for example, use of the input list for training, or more reputation utility based trade, for example, volunteering to increase ones reputation, to ultimately increase its market value in AGI tokens. Correct assignment of credit is needed to promote quality software that satisfys the user, while at the same time assures that developers have a fair shot.  It is expected that agents that learn to  do jobs of uniquely higher quality in uniquely necessary areas will be able to charge higher prices.  Since agents are stateful and able to gain experience from a variety of different problems, it is expected that one way for an agent to gain a higher price would be to reuse and accumulate knowledge in one area, that is, to specialize.  Such agents would contain parameters and functions suited to particular types of problems.  Importantly, these problems need not be expressed in the human designed ontology:  they may involve whatever agent roles are needed in practice to get the job done.  The emergence of automated new constructions and new ontological categories is prerequisite to AIs which can construct themselves and thus supports a singularity.   As agents learn how to buy and sell the services of other agents, particularly higher quality but cheaper agents that they have learned to recognize through sign and test, it is expected that curating agents will emerge.  Curation agents that can both recommend software sucessfully and give new developers a chance to become known satisfy both user and developer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "First, in part one, we introduce the knowledge representation of the communicating agents on the blackboard.  In part two, we demonstrate an initial use of the simulation with a particular reinforcement learning algorithm to construct the AI software, SISTER (Symbolic Interactionist Simulation of Trade and Emergent Roles). SISTER is an evolutionary algorithm that implements Agent-based Coevolution.  This algorithm uses the sign areas of the blackboard communications to learn specialized, non-preprogrammed roles for the agents, emerging needed to solve problems.  Utility/fitness/objective function for individual agents is measured in AGI tokens, making use of Adam Smith's invisible hand rather than group selection coevolution methods that base utility on the good of the whole.  Assignment of credit through the market process is inherit in this method.   As her name suggests, emergent roles in SISTER are macro institutions from the micro-macro integration processes of micro-economics and micro-sociological symbolic interactionism.  Thus SISTER models growth in AI on growth in economy and society."

    "## Part 1.  Representation for Evolvability\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "This simulation uses a \"pickled curry\" representation of python that addresses problems of wastefulness in combinatorial search techniques such as evolutionary algorithms, while at the same time making it easier to evolve AI solutions composed of existing python programs.  Since python is not a tree based language, it is more difficult to evolve than are tree based, functional languages such as Scala, especially those that can easily use their program representations as data such as Scheme.  However, since it is the most used language in data science, we want to be able to put together lego blocks of existing python programs. Python has a few functional programming representations, such as lamdas for unnamed functions.  It does not have currying, but we found an implemenation of currying in python to use.  The pickling of bound curries in this preliminary implementation does not make use of introspection or marshalling, which would be important in making curries that were mobile across machines.  Since pickles can be malicious it is recommended that security issues be handled before this prototype simulation is actually used in competitions.  However, when used for a simulation on a single machine, these curried pickles are saved to disk and kept track of to ensure that nothing need be computed more than once. The code that corresponds to the chosen pickles may be saved separately, using more sophistication than is used in this prototype. However, once security issues are resolved, the curry representation in itself is good for dividing a problem up into parts on mulitple machines for high performance computing, and serialization in itself is good for checkpoint storage of computationally intense functions as are many machine learning functions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Our curry representation constrains python to evolvable pipes, incrementally binding parameters in a seqential manner. Curried programs are closely tied to a tree based representation.  However there is one difference between our curries and many tree based representations that machine learning algorithms such as evolutionary programming are applied to.  Tree based genetic programming has difficulty converging in ways that dont grow too quickly, and in agents that base their interactions on the equilibria of economics, convergence represents a solution, a dynamic compromise, and an institution. SISTER, for example, depends upon the compromise of convergence between agents to develop the institutions of role and role relations that are the solutions to AI integration problems. Trees offer the ability for different modifiers to refer to the same entity without having to rename it, a great advantage in genetic programming (GP).  However, GP programs have difficulty in converging, because growing trees often involve displacing insertions, with small changes in genotype resulting in large changes in phenotype. That is why we combine currying with agents, so that we take advantage of referring to the same entity as trees do, but multiple branches of a tree (forks) are implmented with multiple agents.  In our curried representation, a position corresponds to itself in the next generation so that convergence may occur. However, chromosome size can change as is needed for growth not by insertion but using markers, that is , a stop codon (marker) that moves through introns that lengthens a chromosome but preserves position.  The hierarchical tree structure of the curries also gives gradient to machine learning programs by defining what is a close and what is a distant change, becoming a kind of a gray coding that makes changes that are close in phenotype, close in genotype and changes that are far in phenotype, far in genotype.    \n",
    "\n",
    "The knowledge representation of the agent communications is a vector of floats sent to the openAi blackboard environment as an action. A floating point representation was chosen because it is one of the most general, that can be used or converted into use by any machine learning algorithm.  It makes search in the float parameter space quite easy to add on at a later point. It uses the curry representation, and likewise is designed for evolvability by faciliating convergence and gradient, needed by many machine learning algorithms.  For example, the SISTER algorithm uses the float vector of agent communications as the chromosome inside of an individual CMA-ES algorithm within each agent.  \n",

    "The human-designed ontology is an api of apis that includes an input list and output list in \\*args, \\*\\*kwargs python syntax.  It is used if stop codons appear in the input and output fields, which would be in cases without emergent ontological categories (most cases).  The input and output lists are for cases when the software bought sold or constructed does not occur in the human-designed api, because the agents have invented new software in new categores indicated in the sign fields.  For example, the agents could conceivably invent a new clusterer that wasnt one of the listed ones, in which case they they may indicate a clusterer using the human-designed general category with a stop codon immediately following, and then specify an input and output list.  Because the input and output list is used with software references, it only needs the \\*args syntax.  An offer network example would include only a stop codon in the item field, zero in the price field, and the input and output list, with the sign field taking care of the ontology.  Input and output data structures are not included in the ontology of this example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tests are optional to the agent and used in a buy block to require that software pass with a threshold before it is accepted, with or without revealing the test and data to pass (so that it cant be gamed or trained on).  The same tests in the construct and the sell block indicate that the agent has passed the test, before the item was put on the board, and to have this hidden is a note to the agents self to pass the test before it is put on the board.  Agents do not need such tests in that they could rely on reputation or market price alone to incentivize themselves to quality, but such tests are good points of quality control, and necessary when dealing directly with human beings in establishing criteria for transaction validation. \n"

    "## The API of APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "The human-designed ontology is a particular instance of an API of APIs, in a JSON file.  The official Singularity Net ontology or API of APIs would contain all of the software entered into the singularity net, but this smaller curried pickle representation of the API of APIs is used solely for evolution, and read the official ontology. Different instances of the ontology used in evolution should be created for individual problems, so that the functions that are made available to use in a solution can be reduced to those that are likely to be in that solution over a threshold, so that those functions may be weighted by their likelihood to be in a solution, and so that different parameter values to explore together may be indicated. All these statistical relations between functions and particular solutions can be learned from current solutions in the open source, as in the Microsoft DeepCoder project (https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ByldLrqlx).  However, the hierarchical design of this evolvable ontology could also feed the official version, as the foundation for a convenient checklist that humans could use to specify their desired services, that would take little translation into a version used for evolution. GUIs with checklists could be used by both users and developers to generate the representation.    \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this study is not to define an api of apis with software pattern commonalities so that all of the apis can work together, the central task of the design of an API of APIs. Rather, our goal is to look at general structures to express these commonalities in evolvable and scalable ways that are useful to both integrating agents and humans.  Specifically, we leave the details of data structures, formats, and IO out of the ontology, although we assume that they can be expressed in the same hierarchical format that software functions are. Common and useful data formats as hubs as well as their spoke translators are needed to connect disparate functions together in any manner, including in the pipes and forks of curries of this example.  Here we use the popular format, the pandas Dataframe.  For this prototype, the input and output of functions is the Dataframe with standardized column headings.  We leave data transfer studies for the future so that we can now concentrate on python function evolvability, scalability for evolvability, and a way to keep track of and reuse what has been computed before. \n",

If the simulation were to incorporate the real API, then the simulation could be included in the simulation.  Including the simulation in the simulation, with the checkpoint and restart of the curried pickles to inspect different branches that could be taken, is important to strategic modelling, for example the coevolutionary recursion of models of attacks upon and defense of the singularity net.   \n",

    "The hierarchical representation in the ontology (api of apis) has consistent levels, from root to branch, of function type, datatype or brand, algorithm, parameter1,parmeter 2 ,parameter3, etc. As consistancy is important for evolvability, care is taken in creating the JSON file to list parmeters in a consistent order, for example the number of clusters in clustering algorithms might all be listed first. The siblings within a level are also listed in a meaningful order, for example all clustering algorithms might should be sampled at 10 clusters, 30 clusters and 50 clusters.  Some paths from root to branch in the example ontology are test-clusterer-silouhette, data-freetext-internetResearchAgency, and vectorSpace-gensim-doc2vec-50size-200iterations-2minFrq.   50size, 200iterations, and 2minFrq are three parameter values that our ontology designates should be tested together in gensim's doc2vec algorithm, a vectorSpace algorithm. Admitedly there are many more possible combinations of parameters that can be explored than can be explicated individually in a JSON file, but these are the ones that are worth saving to disk as checkpoints. Algorithms can still be used to zero in on exact float values and parmeter relations, but we would not save all combinations of these parmeter values to disk.   Because we are dealing with curried functions, a function with one of the parmeters bound is itself a function.  From root to branch we go from more general to more and more specific functions, until when all values are bound, the output of the function only differs if it is stochastic.

    "Internal variables as opposed to the next level of the tree start with an underscore, and inherit values from parent nodes if they are not specified in a child node.  The internal variables at each level include those we would expect in an api, the types of the input and output, in key word arguments as well as arguments, plus a pickle file and a weight.  The ontology doesnt say that each of the pickles in the curried functions to the right of the basic function exist, only that if they are pickled and saved, what their name would be.  Currently, only completely bound and called functions are pickled, but there may be times when the computation/space tradeoff or the division of computation across machines calls for the pickling (or marshalling) of partially bound functions. In the ontology file, the input values that are not bound are the ones expected from other agents. If two or more inputs are not bound, then the input of two or more agents is required. Although more than one output is allowed in python, they are not in this protptype curried representation. The weight internal variable is normalized with its siblings, and represents the probability that that a sibling node occurs in a solution given the parent node. It can be filled in with data from techniques that use the likelihood of function use given the problem such as Microsoft's DeepCoder. Right now, however, the liklihood of any child is the same.  \n",

    "The hierarchical design of functions gives gradient to the vector of floats representation of an item (to buy, sell, or construct)  in the agent communication to the blackboard. Each float in the float vector representation of an item represents a level in the hierarchy, with the values of floats to the left determining the meanings of floats to the right.  The first float in this hierarchy, is whether the node is a test, or data, or preprocessor, or vectorSpace or clusterer.  Since in this case, they are all equally weighted, each has a 20% chance of being picked. If, say, the float in position 1 fell in the range of clusterer, of values .8 and above, then floats above .5 in position 2 might indicate the brand NLTK, since there are two brands.  Since the string ends with a stop codon on the left, and more specific answers occur on the left, a consensus about general facts about the item may form, or converge, before the specific facts about an item.  This representation works with gene switches which can be disruptive, but the consistency of the meanings of the levels helps to mitigate disruptions to the left.   For example, a 300 size vector would mean the same thing in a vector space whether the brand was NLTK or scikit learn.  \n",

We have generated python program from agent communications about buying, selling, and constructing software.  This representation can make use of statistics about the frequency of functions occurring in problem types, such as in Microsoft's Deep coder.  In part two we will address a coevolutionary representation that leverages a rich heterogeneous environment to make the evolution of python programs within reach. "
